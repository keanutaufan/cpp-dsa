# C++ Data Structures and Algorithms

Implementation of various popular data structures and algorithms in C++
with clear explanations.

## What is this?

This repository contains popular data structures and algorithms
(mostly simple stuff) implemented in C++ with its explanations.
I will try to document and explain the code as clearly as possible,
so more people can learn from my journey.

## Contents

### Data Structures

- [Stack](DataStructure/Stack)
- [Queue](DataStructure/Queue)
- [Deque](DataStructure/Deque)
- [Linked List](DataStructure/LinkedList)
- [Binary Search Tree (with fair explanation about binary tree)](DataStructure/BinarySearchTree)

more to come...

## Important Notice

The implementations of hosted algorithms and data structures are not
necessarily the most efficient, nor are they guaranteed to be bug-free.
After all, this repository is intended to serve as a reference and learning
resource rather than a production-ready library for large-scale applications.
If you are planning to do something serious, I recommend using C++
STL or a well-maintained library like [Boost](https://github.com/boostorg/boost). 
Should you wish to use this code, please do so at your own risk.

## Contributing

Though it is not heavily targeted towards real-world applications, I'd like
to make the collection of these algorithms and data structures as efficient
and safe as possible, to the point that this project is good
enough to be used for production. So if you find any bug or inefficiency,
please open an issue or send a pull request.

You can also contribute to non-code parts of this repository. After all,
this is a learning resource, and I'd like to make it as clear and
understandable as possible. Here are some ways you can help:

- Spot and fix typos and grammatical errors. I'm not a native English
  speaker, so any wordsmithing is appreciated.
- Report any broken links. I may have missed some links when I was
  moving files around, or I may have deleted some files that are still
  linked to. There are also some external links in the references that may
  be broken. However, there may be some links pointing to some data structures
  or algorithms that are not yet implemented, in which case I intentionally
  left them as I am planning to implement them in the future.
- Correct any misleading or incorrect explanations. If you spot any
  of these, please let me know before it misleads other readers.
- Improve the explanations! We need feedback from you as the reader to
  make this resource better. Did you find something confusing? Did you
  find something that could be explained better? Did you find any
  explanation that was awkwardly phrased? Let me know!
- Add or revise graphs and diagrams. I'm not a designer, so if you have
  any ideas on how to make the them better, please let me know.
- Eventually, I'd like to replace some of the graphics with animations to make
  the explanations more intuitive once I have the time to do so. My goal is to
  have them in every algorithm and data structure operations that needs them.
  If you are interested in helping me with this, please contact me.

Currently, I'm not accepting pull requests for new algorithms and data
structures until I define a proper contribution guideline (i.e. style guide).
However, I'm open to suggestions for new algorithms and data structures to add.
