# C++ Data Structures and Algorithms

Implementation of various popular data structures and algorithms in C++
with clear explanations.

## What is this?

This repository contains popular data structures and algorithms
(mostly simple stuff) implemented in C++ with its explanations.
I will try to document and explain the code as clearly as possible,
so more people can learn from my journey.

## Contents

### Data Structures

- [Stack](DataStructure/Stack)
- [Queue](DataStructure/Queue)
- [Deque](DataStructure/Deque)
- [Linked List](DataStructure/LinkedList)

more to come...

## Important Notice

The implementations of hosted algorithms and data structures are not
necessarily the most efficient, nor are they guaranteed to be bug-free.
After all, this repository is intended to serve as a reference and learning
resource rather than a production-ready library for large-scale applications.
If you are planning to do something serious, I recommend using C++
STL or a well-maintained library like [Boost](https://github.com/boostorg/boost). 
Should you wish to use this code, please do so at your own risk.

## Contributing

Though it is not heavily targeted towards real-world applications, I'd like
to make the collection of these algorithms and data structures as efficient
and safe as possible, to the point that this project is good
enough to be used for production. So if you find any bug or inefficiency,
please open an issue or send a pull request.
